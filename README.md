# Group Learn

Welcome to Group Learn a site designed for students to work together to find help in Math, Art, English, and Science.
Students can give the area that they are looking to find others to study with on then the specific category they are looking to study. This is a great way for students to make connections and learn together.

## Reason we made this program 

We decided to make this site because we saw a need for students that would want to find a group of people to work on getting better in a chosen subject on their time and outside of school.
